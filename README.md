## Project Overview:
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive market analysis for a chicken meat sales company aspiring to expand its operations internationally. Leveraging Python, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and clustering techniques, the project aims to identify key insights and opportunities in the target markets.

## Methods Used:
Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data dimensionality reduction.
Clustering with Kmeans and Hierarchical Clustering.
Cluster characterization and application of a scoring system.

## Data Cleaning:
Data preparation from various sources for analysis on a single dataframe (163 countries).

## PCA Method:
Reduction of data complexity.
Selection of two principal components using the "elbow of eigenvalues."
Visualization of country similarities with the first factorial plane.

## Clustering Methods:
Implementation of Kmeans for data partitioning.
Determination of the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
Cluster characterization with boxplots.
Usage of Hierarchical Clustering (CAH) to explore data structure.

## Cluster Characterization:
Comparison of results between Kmeans and CAH using a heatmap.
Validation of Kmeans results.
Visualization of country importers with a GeoMap.

## Scoring and Results:
Application of scoring in two scenarios: ecological and social vs business.
Identification of the top three countries in each scenario.
Flexibility to adjust weights based on business needs.

# Conclusion:
This project provides a strategic market analysis for a chicken meat sales company, utilizing advanced techniques like PCA and clustering. The results offer a nuanced understanding of international markets, allowing the company to tailor its approach for successful expansion.
